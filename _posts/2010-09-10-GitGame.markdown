Developing is fun! Well, it *can* be.

My employer, [Liquid Media](http://www.liquidmedia.ca), uses [Teambox](http://www.teambox.com) for our project management, and (*obviously*) Git for our VC.

I'm a fairly junior developer, working on my productivity. For me, the following things are true in order to get me productive.

1. I need a sense of accomplishment
2. I need a sense of urgency
3. I love a sense of fun

So I've decided to turn Git into a game! Last week I made a very rudimentary "health bar" for a Git Repository. I used Objective-C as my language of choice. All it does is monitor the results of git diff --numstat on a directory. It subtracts the sum of all added and removed lines from your "health", and gives you a visual indicator that you haven't committed, and that by golly, you should!

This isn't very fun, yet. So I'm going to incorporate a sense of urgency!

I'd like to be nagged when I haven't commited in a half hour, and furthermore, I'd like to be nagged when I haven't pushed my changes in two hours.

**So here we go!**
